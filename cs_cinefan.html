          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <img
            src="assets/img/portfolio/CineFan_images/CineFan_main.png"

          />
          <p>
            CineFan is a web app which I developed using the MERN stack. It
            provides registered users with an array of movies and access to
            information about their directors, genres, and a brief description.
            Users must register in order to access this content. Once they have
            done so, users can update their own personal information and create
            a list of favourite movies to be stored in their account.
          </p>
          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            I created CineFan as part of my training in full-stack web
            development with CareerFoundry. This project was specifically part
            of the Client-Side Programming & React module.
          </p>
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of this project was to hone and ultimately demonstrate
            my skill with both front- and back-end development. The goal was to
            create a complete server-side and client-side application from
            scratch.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a personal level, I wanted to build something with a simple yet striking visual style, which could be used to easily find information about some of my favourite movies. Most people are familiar with IMDB, but I wanted to make a simpler, more curated version of that concept with a greater emphasis on style and appearance.

        <h2>The Build Process</h2>
        <img
            src="assets/img/portfolio/CineFan_images/CineFan_db.png"
            class="cs_processImage"
            alt="CineFan Database Sample"
          /> 
        <h3>Back-End</h3>
        <p>
          The server-side consists of a REST API, built using Node.js and
          Express. This interacts with MongoDB, a non-relational database. The
          API is accessed via HTTP methods, such as GET and POST, in order to
          keep interactions with it straightforward. These follow a CRUD method
          to update, retrieve, and store data. When required, information is
          provided by the API in JSON format.
        </p>
        <p>
          The API endpoints were tested using Postman. Once these initial tests
          passed, I added user authentication and authorization using basic HTTP
          and JWT authentication. The endpoints can be viewed here:
          <br />
          <a href="#">View API endpoints</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Front-End</h2>
        <p>
          The front-end portion of the application was built using React and
          React-Redux as a responsive, single-page application. It consists of
          multiple views, including a main view, which displays all movies in a
          grid format, a movie view, which displays information about an
          individual movie (and which is also used to display information about
          directors and genres), and a profile view, where users can view or
          edit their information and see their list of favourites.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Whilst I loved working on this project, there were several challenges encountered along the way. Firstly, it took me some time to wrap my head around React. I'm a person who wants to know <strong>how</strong> everything works, and is never satisfied with saying "it works, but I have no idea why". Whilst learning React, I found some tools, such as the useState Hook, fell into this category. I had to slow down, go over them piece by piece, and discuss with my mentor what each step did before I fully understood them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, I also encountered several problems with the actual hosting of the front-end component. I initially wanted to use Netlify to host the app, but due to an error on Netlify’s end I was unable to do so. Rather than waste time waiting for them to address the problem, I switched to Heroku for my hosting service. This came with its own challenges, as Heroku didn’t recognize the app’s file naming convention at first. With the help of my mentor, I rebuilt the front-end of the app and the Heroku project to better integrate the two. I also combined the front- and back-end repositories on GitHub into a single repo.
        </p>
        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>
          The development of this app took a bit longer than expected, due to my initial difficulty in understanding React. Once I got more up to speed with React, however, I encountered the hosting challenges described above. All told, the complete development of this app took about twice as long as I was expecting it to.
